      <description>jq is famously known as a powerful command-line JSON parser. Besides performing as a parser, jq has many other handy usages as well. Here, I&amp;rsquo;d like to share 3 jq tips you may need to know.
JSON Prettier When we curl API to fetch JSON response with raw data. It certainly looks messy:
$ curl https://api.spacexdata.com/v4/launches/latest {&amp;#34;fairings&amp;#34;:{&amp;#34;reused&amp;#34;:false,&amp;#34;recovery_attempt&amp;#34;:true,&amp;#34;recovered&amp;#34;:null,&amp;#34;ships&amp;#34;:[&amp;#34;5ea6ed2e080df4000697c907&amp;#34;,&amp;#34;5ea6ed2e080df4000697c908&amp;#34;]},...&amp;#34;id&amp;#34;:&amp;#34;5ef6a2e70059c33cee4a8293&amp;#34;} Now let&amp;rsquo;s toss raw data into jq and make it look prettier:

      <description>Git alias is powerful and yet simple to set up. I&amp;rsquo;d like to share my journey in configuring git alias for my personal use. Now let&amp;rsquo;s dig it and git it!
Day 1: Why git alias? I was using Tig for some time. It&amp;rsquo;s good but not great. The problems I got during the time:
 It takes time to memorize the default key bindings. Since I&amp;rsquo;m using Colemak keyboard layout, obviously, the default navigation key bindings need to be adjusted accordingly.</description>

      <description>Photo by Mitch Lensink   Let&amp;rsquo;s start with your imagination: in a team discussion, someone purposes a solution to solve a certain problem. However, another person expresses a strong opinion against that solution. The discussion is heating up with arguments on two sides back and forth. You are sitting there in your zone silently and listening to the whole conversation insouciantly.
Suddenly, someone asks you, &amp;ldquo;What&amp;rsquo;s your opinion?</description>

Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m a part of the problem by generating noisy contents: low-quality jokes, unrealistic complaints, and aggressive arguments&amp;hellip; Once I realized that, the feeling like a commuter in a subway during rush hour: being pushed around forward and backward, I cannot stand still for myself.</description>

      <description>Time truly flies. It has been 20 months since I switched from QWERTY to Colemak keyboard layout. Am I now able to type on the Colemak keyboard as fast as the time flies? Certainly not. My typing speed 20 months ago was 75 WPM on average with QWERTY, now it&amp;rsquo;s 85 WPM on average with Colemak. I can feel the improvement and that&amp;rsquo;s why I never look back to QWERTY again.</description>

      <description>The proverb says, &amp;ldquo;The palest ink is better than the best memory&amp;rdquo;. Note-taking is certainly an essential part of knowledge learning, information collecting and retaining. In the fast-changing digital era, pen, ink and paper may not be able to fulfill the important job of note-taking anymore. So, what&amp;rsquo;s a killer note-taking system nowadays?
My requirements? My dream system must be Easy, Efficient and Flexible:
 Know where &amp;amp; how to write notes easily without hesitations Find right notes &amp;amp; roll back to old changes efficiently without hassles Convert notes to other formats and share them flexibly without troubles  Build it!</description>

      <description>.lnt { display: none }  Almost a decade ago, I started to touch the command-line interface (CLI). I&amp;rsquo;m now a nerdy CLI lover and I&amp;rsquo;m so obsessed by its efficiency. Therefore, I&amp;rsquo;m always trying out new command-line commands. From time to time, some commands are replaced by other improved ones in my daily workflow. Especially for some frequently used commands, it&amp;rsquo;s worth to find better alternatives.
Here is a list of improved commands I&amp;rsquo;d like to share with you:</description>

      <description>Photo by Garrett LeSage   In case you are seeking for an answer of the question: &amp;ldquo;Do I need to switch from Chrome to Firefox now?&amp;rdquo; In my opinion, if you&amp;rsquo;re still happy with Chrome, then feel comfortable to stay with Chrome. Because there is no obvious game-changing reason for switching.
So, what&amp;rsquo;s new about Firefox?
New Name Half year ago, you may (or may not) notice that I said Goodbye to Firefox.</description>

 A good tester asks good questions. Asking questions is a must-have skill for a software tester. Therefore, as a software tester, I see asking questions as a privilege, which is allowed under any circumstances. However, asking questions is not always easy. We all know sometimes a bad question may cause some communication troubles:</description>

      <description>Last weekend, I decided to switch from QWERTY to Colemak keyboard layout. Did I suffer a lot since then? Of course no, well, maybe a little bit. After &amp;ldquo;one-week intensive typing training&amp;rdquo;, actually I quite enjoy the fresh feeling of typing with Colemak. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy that now I am able to type on Colemak keyboard layout with the average speed 50 WPM. I would say that it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for daily life.</description>

      <description>Colemak, pronounced /&amp;lsquo;ko:lmæk/ (Coal-Mac), is a keyboard layout based on QWERTY. It&amp;rsquo;s developed by Shai Coleman and released in 2006. Colemak keyboard layout looks like:
q w f p g j l u y ; a r s t d h n e i o z x c v b k m , . / What&amp;rsquo;s special about Colemak? Why do I decide to switch from QWERTY to Colemak?
Reason 1: Discard QWERTY As we all known, QWERTY was originally designed for the typewriter to solve the problem of the type bars colliding with each other and jamming.</description>

      <description>Photo by Sai Kiran Anagani Vijayawada   Animation is fun. It makes everything look vivid. A good animation is that you won&amp;rsquo;t notice its existence but it pleases your eyes and makes you feel good!
To see fancy animations is really enjoyable, but to make it is not. Specially for me, a CSS -webkit newbie, creating animations with CSS is a dirty job. It needs a lot of guess work and experiments to archive the expect results.</description>

 Every sprint, we have a team testing session with one hour fixed time slot. It&amp;rsquo;s a team-fun-thing for all team members to try out new features. I take the honor to organize this testing party. But unfortunately, the last sprint I failed to prepare test devices in time, which causes that the team testing didn&amp;rsquo;t end very well.</description>

To be honest, the initial configuration is simple but I cannot recall it at all. That&amp;rsquo;s why I finally decide to write down this quick note, for the forgetful people, like me.</description>

      <description>Software Testing is a huge topic. The types of software testing are enormous. Tons of terminologies and syllabuses could make people feel sick. A small example:
 When I say &amp;ldquo;Integration Testing&amp;rdquo;, You may interpret as &amp;ldquo;Functional Testing&amp;rdquo;, Your tester friend may think it&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Accessibility Testing&amp;rdquo;, Your developer buddy may consider it as &amp;ldquo;Regression Testing&amp;rdquo;, Your PO bro may see it as &amp;ldquo;Automated Testing&amp;rdquo;.  Actually we are more or less talking about the same thing.</description>

 Recently I read an interesting article about Why do programmers wear headphones?. The truth is that &amp;ldquo;programmers are easily distracted, headphones eliminate some distractions, thus headphones make programmers.&amp;quot; To reduce losing attention by distractions, I could improve my attention span and control the working environment around myself. But on the other hand, I could lose my attention as well by interruptions, which are usually unexpected.</description>

Why hexo was chosen? Let&amp;rsquo;s start from the reasons why I ditched jekyll without any regrets:
 Hexo has a good name   Hexo is powered by Node.js Hexo is easy to deploy Hexo supports theme change Hexo is pretty fast  Honestly hexo is quite good and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy living with it.</description>

 Last week, I made my decision to switch from Firefox to Chromium. Although it&amp;rsquo;s not my first time trying to ditch Firefox, I&amp;rsquo;m quite sure this time it would be the last time.

At that time, I was kidding that 3 min in that post title was actually the time to finish reading that post. But today, I could make this raving come true with hexo, a super simple and powerful static blog generator. I switched immediately from jekyll to hexo. Really? Why hexo, why not jekyll anymore?</description>

 Preface I admit that I failed to use Calabash for mobile testing. It was a big failure but it was beautiful, I call it reckless passion. Although I learned a lot from it, I&amp;rsquo;ve never shared what I learned in public. After that, I changed my focus and gave up on traditional UI automation.</description>

 The methods to classify a bug are various, depend on its impact, visibility, related component, related testing phase[1] &amp;hellip; I wonder: if bugs are warriors whom we&amp;rsquo;ve to fight against, what are their classifications? In this post, I&amp;rsquo;m gonna try to explain an interesting bug classification idea, called Bugshido.
As we all know, Bushido: 武士道 the way (Dō or Tao) of the warrior (Bushi), is used symbolically in its sense of way, as the right way of existence of warriors.</description>

 Damn old picture of team testing When we talk about team testing, I guess many of you will image a picture in your mind:
  People are sitting around a table.
  Everyone gets a paper in front of them. This paper could be a checklist full of test steps, could be a sheet full of test scenarios&amp;hellip;</description>

      <description>I write this tutorial with some notes about how to build a github.io blog, because I was struggling a bit on it (well, I&amp;rsquo;m a dummy). Hope this post will give you a clear view and make you enjoy the build-up phrase. Then after that, you could waste some of your time on customizing your own awesome blog. 😉
(What about 3 min? It&amp;rsquo;s the time to read this post&amp;hellip;)</description>
