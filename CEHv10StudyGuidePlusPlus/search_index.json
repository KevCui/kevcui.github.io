controls\n\nPreventive: controls used to stop potential attacks by preventing users from performing specific actions, such as encryption and authentication\nDetective: controls used to monitor and alert on malicious or unauthorized activity, such as IDS's and CCTV feeds monitored in real life, record any intrusion attempts\nDeterrent: controls used to discourage potential attackers and send warning messages to the attackers, such as signs that warn possible attackers about the alarm system and monitoring in place\nCompensating: controls used to supplement directive controls when the intended control is failed, such as administrator reviewing logs files for violations of company policy\nCorrective: controls designed to fix things after an attack has been discovered and

However, can also help against SSL encryption\n\n\n\nOffline\n\nWhen the hacker steals a copy of the password file and does the cracking on a separate system\nDictionary Attack: using a word list to attack the password, the fastest method of attacking\nBrute force Attack\nTries every combination of characters to crack a password\nCan be faster if you know parameters (such as at least 7 characters, should have a special character, etc.)\n\n\nRule-based Attack: attacker obtains some information about the password\nHybrid Attack: taking a dictionary attack and replaces characters (such as a 0 for an o) or adds numbers to the end\nSyllable Attack: when passwords are not known words, attackers use the dictionary and other methods to crash them, as well as all possible dominations of them\n\n\nRainbow tables: using pre-hashed passwords to compare against a password hash. Is faster because the hashes are already computed\nDistributed Network Attack (DNA): recovering password protected files that uses unused processing power of machines across the network to decrypt passwords\nTools\nCain\nJohn the Ripper\n\n\n\nPrivilege Escalation\nTypes of Privilege Escalation\n\nVertical: lower-level user executes code at a higher privilege level\nHorizontal: executing code at the same user level but from a location that would be protected from that access\n\nFour Methods\n\nCrack the password of an admin, primary aim\nTake advantage of an OS vulnerability\nDLL Hijacking: replacing a DLL in the application directory with your own version which gives you the access you need\n\n\nUse a tool that will provide you the access such as Metasploit\nSocial engineering a user to run an application\n\nExecuting Applications\n\nExecuting things such as keyloggers, spyware, back doors and crackers\nECC refers executing applications as owning a system\n\nHiding Files\nADS (Alternate Data Stream)\n\nWorks only on Windows\nHides a file from directory listing on an NTFS file system\nCan be run by start readme.txt:badfile.exe\nCan also create a link to this and make it look real: mklink innocent.exe readme.txt:badfile.exe\nCountermeasures\nShow ADS: dir /r\nBlow away all ADS by copying files to a FAT partition\nEvery forensic kit looks for this\n\n\n\nAttribute\n\nIn Windows: attrib +h filename\nIn Linux: simply add a dot . to the beginning of the filename\n\nSteganography\n\nSteganography can hide data and files, more details in ./11-Cryptography.md\n\nRootkit\n\nSoftware puts in place by attacker to obscure system compromise\nHiding processes and files\nAlso allowing for future access\nExamples:\nHorsepill: Linus kernel rootkit inside initrd\nGrayfish: Windows rootkit that injects in boot record\nAzazel\nAvatar\nNecurs\nZeroAccess\n\n\nOne way to detect rootkits is to map all the files on a system and then boot a system from a clean CD version and compare the two file systems\n\nTypes of Rootkits\n\nHypervisor level: rootkits that modify the boot sequence of a host system to load a VM as the host OS\nHardware level: hiding malware in devices or firmware\nBoot loader level: replacing boot loader with one controlled by hacker\nApplication level: directed to replace valid application files with Trojans\nKernel level: attacking boot sectors (MBR: Master Boot Record) and kernel level replacing kernel code with back-door code; most dangerous\nLibrary level: using system-level calls to hide themselves\n\nCovering Tracks\n\nDon't just delete, key sign that an attack has happened. Option is to corrupt a log file, because this can happen all the time.\nBest option is to be selective and delete the entries pertaining to your actions\nAlso disabling auditing ahead of time to prevent logs from being captured\nIn Windows: need to clear application, system and security logs; Tool Elsave can clear Windows logs\nIn Windows: clear MRU (Most Recent Used) list\nclearev: meterpreter shell command to clear log files\nTime stomping: manipulating time stamps on files, used to set file times which to throw off investigations or identify intrusions\n\n"},"06-web_server_and_web_application_hacking.html":{"url":"06-web_server_and_web_application_hacking.html","title":"06-Web Server and Web Application Hacking","keywords":"","body":"06-Web Server and Web Application Hacking\nTable of Contents\n\nWeb Server and Web Application Hacking\nWeb Organizations\nOWASP Web Top 10 Application Security Risks 2017\nWeb Server Architecture\nTechnology Stacks\n\n\nWeb Server Attack Methodology\nWeb Server and Application Attacks\nInjections\nFile Injection\nCommand Injection\nLDAP Injection\nSOAP Injection\nSQL Injection\n\n\nXSS (Cross-site scripting)\nCSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery)\nClickjacking\nBuffer Overflow (Smashing the stack)\nOther attacks\n\n\n\n\n\nWeb Server and Web Application Hacking\nWeb Organizations\n\nWeb 2.0: dynamic applications;

They are installed in a private or non-routable space, or the Internet-addressable portion of an organization's network. If they are installed in the private network or, in other words, behind the firewall, they cannot always detect outside attacks.\nService-Based Solutions\nService-based solutions are offered by third parties, such as auditing or security consulting firms. Some solutions are hosted inside the network; others are hosted outside the network. A drawback of this solution is that attackers can audit the network from outside.\nTree-Based Assessment\nIn a tree-based assessment, the auditor selects different strategies for each machine or component of the information system. This approach relies on the administrator to provide a starting shot of intelligence, and then to start scanning continuously without incorporating any information found at the time of scanning.\nInference-Based Assessment\nIn an inference-based assessment, scanning starts by building an inventory of protocols found on the machine. After finding a protocol, the scanning process starts to detect which ports are attached to services. After finding services, it selects vulnerabilities on each machine and starts to execute only those relevant tests.\nPenetration Testing\n\nLooking for vulnerabilities and actively seeking to exploit them\nNeed to make sure you have a great contract in place to protect you from liability\nClearly defined, full scale test of security controls\n\nPhases of Pen Testing\n\nPre-Attack Phase: reconnaissance and data-gathering\nPlanning and preparation: Rule of Engagement (RoE)\nMethodology design\nNetwork information gathering\n\n\nAttack Phase: attempts to penetrate the network and execute attacks\nPenetrating perimeter\nAcquiring target\nEscalating privileges\nExecution, implantation, retracting\n\n\nPost-Attack Phase: cleanup to return a system to the pre-attack condition and deliver reports\nReporting\nClean-up\nArtifact destruction\n\n\n\nTypes of Pen Testing\n\nBlack Box: without any knowledge of the system or network\nWhite Box: complete knowledge of the system\nGray Box: some knowledge of the system and/or network\nExternal Assessment: analyzing publicly available information; conducting network scanning, enumeration and testing from the network perimeter\nInternal Assessment: performed from within the organization, from various network access points\n\nTeams\n\nRed Team: attacking\nBlue Team: defending\nPurple Team: doing both attacking and defending\n\nAutomated Testing Tools\n\nMetasploit: framework for developing and executing code against a remote target machine\nCore Impact Pro: best known, all-inclusive automated testing framework, tests everything from web applications and individual systems to network devices and wireless\nCANVAS: hundreds of exploits, automated exploitation system and extensive exploit development framework\n\nSecurity Testing Methodology\nProprietary Methodologies\n\nIBM\nMcAfee Foundstone\nEC-Council LPT: Licensed Penetration Tester\n\nOpen-Source and Public Methodologies\n\nOWASP: Open Web Application Security Project\nOSSTMM: Open-Source Security Testing Methodology Manual\nISSAF: Information System Security Assessment Framework\nNIST: National Institute of Standards and Technology\n\n"}}}
