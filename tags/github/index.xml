      <description>It has been 2 months since I switched from Hexo to Hugo. Everything went smoothly. Until yesterday, I made a small mistake. I messed up my entire blog Git repository, then I have to reconfigure the part of deploying Hugo website to Github Pages&amp;hellip;
To be honest, the initial configuration is simple but I cannot recall it at all. That&amp;rsquo;s why I finally decide to write down this quick note, for the forgetful people, like me.</description>

      <description>I write this tutorial with some notes about how to build a github.io blog, because I was struggling a bit on it (well, I&amp;rsquo;m a dummy). Hope this post will give you a clear view and make you enjoy the build-up phrase. Then after that, you could waste some of your time on customizing your own awesome blog. ðŸ˜‰
(What about 3 min? It&amp;rsquo;s the time to read this post&amp;hellip;)</description>
