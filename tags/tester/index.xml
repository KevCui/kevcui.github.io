      <description>Photo by Gabriel   Before we dive deep into something serious, relax, let&amp;rsquo;s start with a joke first. If it&amp;rsquo;s funny to you, then it&amp;rsquo;s true.
How many QA does it take to change a light bulb? None, we just report the darkness.
&amp;mdash; RoboCoonieâ„¢ | Fluffoâ„¢ (@RoboCoonie) December 24, 2008  Now let me tell you a truth from the darkness: I don&amp;rsquo;t like people calling me QA, especially those who know me.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;Photography is an art of observation. It&amp;rsquo;s about finding something interesting in an ordinary place&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Elliott Erwitt
 Since the beginning of this year, I took photography as a &amp;ldquo;serious&amp;rdquo; hobby. The interesting thing I found is that the more I have learned about photography, the more I can feel the similarities between photography and software testing.</description>

      <description>Photo by Jonathan Simcoe    &amp;ldquo;You should not ask questions without knowledge.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; W. Edwards Deming
 A good tester asks good questions. Asking questions is a must-have skill for a software tester. Therefore, as a software tester, I see asking questions as a privilege, which is allowed under any circumstances. However, asking questions is not always easy. We all know sometimes a bad question may cause some communication troubles:</description>

 I&amp;rsquo;m a tester. When a developer talks to me, I see myself as a rubber duck.
A rubber duck? Why not Winnie-the-Pooh, Pikachu or Minion? Because the color doesn&amp;rsquo;t matter ðŸ˜‰ But other things do matter.</description>

 Recently I read an interesting article about Why do programmers wear headphones?. The truth is that &amp;ldquo;programmers are easily distracted, headphones eliminate some distractions, thus headphones make programmers.&amp;rdquo; To reduce losing attention by distractions, I could improve my attention span and control the working environment around myself.</description>
