      <description>&amp;ldquo;Habit is habit, and not to be flung out of the window by any man, but coaxed down-stairs one step at a time.&amp;rdquo; ― Mark Twain

      <description>&amp;ldquo;A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Lao Tzu
 There is a tradition in Japan since 1995: Every year, one character will be chosen as kanji of the year at Kiyomizu Temple, which represents the events of the entire year.
So I choose the character of my year 2016 is Shi It means: to start, beginning.
Begin to connect 01 Jan 2016: A new habit Actually it&amp;rsquo;s easy for me to build this habit.</description>
