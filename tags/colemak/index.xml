      <description>Time truly flies. It has been 20 months since I switched from QWERTY to Colemak keyboard layout. Am I now able to type on the Colemak keyboard as fast as the time flies? Certainly not. My typing speed 20 months ago was 75 WPM on average, now it&amp;rsquo;s 85 WPM on average. I can feel the improvement and that&amp;rsquo;s why I never look back to QWERTY again.
Besides things mentioned in One Week with Colemak, are there somethings special happened during these 20 months?</description>

      <description>Last weekend, I decided to switch from QWERTY to Colemak keyboard layout. Did I suffer a lot since then? Of course no, well, maybe a little bit. After &amp;ldquo;one-week intensive typing training&amp;rdquo;, actually I quite enjoy the fresh feeling of typing with Colemak. I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy that now I am able to type on Colemak keyboard layout with the average speed 50 WPM. I would say that it&amp;rsquo;s good enough for daily life.</description>
