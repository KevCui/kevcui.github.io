      <description>Do you remember several months ago I wrote a post about how to build github.io blog in 3 min? At that time, I was kidding that 3 min in that post title was actually the time to finish reading that post. But today, I could make this raving come true with hexo, a super simple and powerful static blog generator. I switched immediately from jekyll to hexo. Really? Why hexo, why not jekyll anymore?</description>

      <description>I write this tutorial with some notes about how to build a github.io blog, because I was struggling a bit on it (well, I&amp;rsquo;m a dummy). Hope this post will give you a clear view and make you enjoy the build-up phrase. Then after that, you could waste some of your time on customizing your own awesome blog. üòâ
(What about 3 min? It&amp;rsquo;s the time to read this post&amp;hellip;)</description>
