      <description>As you probably remember that I just about switched from jekyll to hexo 2 months ago, now I&amp;rsquo;m again switching from hexo to hugo. Am I crazy? Yep. You want to know why? Let me tell you.
Why hexo was chosen? Let&amp;rsquo;s start from the reasons why I ditched jekyll without any regrets:
Hexo has a good name Hexo is powered by Node.js Hexo is easy to deploy Hexo supports theme change Hexo is pretty fast Honestly hexo is quite good and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy living with it.</description>

      <description>Do you remember several months ago I wrote a post about how to build github.io blog in 3 min? At that time, I was kidding that 3 min in that post title was actually the time to finish reading that post. But today, I could make this raving come true with hexo, a super simple and powerful static blog generator. I switched immediately from jekyll to hexo. Really? Why hexo, why not jekyll anymore?</description>
