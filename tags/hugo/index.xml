      <description>It has been 2 months since I switched from Hexo to Hugo. Everything went smoothly. Until yesterday, I made a small mistake. I messed up my entire blog Git repository, then I have to reconfigure the part of deploying Hugo website to Github Pages&amp;hellip;
To be honest, the initial configuration is simple but I cannot recall it at all. That&amp;rsquo;s why I finally decide to write down this quick note, for the forgetful people, like me.</description>

      <description>As you probably remember that I just about switched from jekyll to hexo 2 months ago, now I&amp;rsquo;m again switching from hexo to hugo. Am I crazy? Yep. You want to know why? Let me tell you.
Why hexo was chosen? Let&amp;rsquo;s start from the reasons why I ditched jekyll without any regrets:
Hexo has a good name Hexo is powered by Node.js Hexo is easy to deploy Hexo supports theme change Hexo is pretty fast Honestly hexo is quite good and I&amp;rsquo;m pretty happy living with it.</description>
