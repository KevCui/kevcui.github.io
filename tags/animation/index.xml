      <description>Photo by Sai Kiran Anagani Vijayawada   Animation is fun. It makes everything look vivid. A good animation is that you won&amp;rsquo;t notice its existence but it pleases your eyes and makes you feel good!
To see fancy animations is really enjoyable, but to make it is not. Specially for me, a CSS -webkit newbie, creating animations with CSS is a dirty job. It needs a lot of guess work and experiments to archive the expect results.</description>
