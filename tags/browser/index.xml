      <description>Photo by Garrett LeSage   In case you are seeking for an answer of the question: &amp;ldquo;Do I need to switch from Chrome to Firefox now?&amp;rdquo; In my opinion, if you&amp;rsquo;re still happy with Chrome, then feel comfortable to stay with Chrome. Because there is no obvious game-changing reason for switching.

      <description>Photo by Garrrett LeSage    Love, without any reason. Leave, with a good reason.
 Last week, I made my decision to switch from Firefox to Chromium. Although it&amp;rsquo;s not my first time trying to ditch Firefox, I&amp;rsquo;m quite sure this time it would be the last time. As I&amp;rsquo;m a reasonable person, therefore, I put my thoughts in this post with the reason why I made my decision.</description>
