      <description>Photo by Garrrett LeSage Love, without any reason. Leave, with a good reason.&#xA;Last week, I made my decision to switch from Firefox to Chromium. Although it&amp;rsquo;s not my first time trying to ditch Firefox, I&amp;rsquo;m quite sure this time it would be the last time. As I&amp;rsquo;m a reasonable person, therefore, I put my thoughts in this post with the reason why I made my decision.&#xA;A pressure from outside I didn&amp;rsquo;t really remember since when I started to use Firefox, I always have it as my main browser.</description>
