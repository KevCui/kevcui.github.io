      <description>--  &amp;ldquo;Photography is an art of observation. It&amp;rsquo;s about finding something interesting in an ordinary place&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;ve found it has little to do with the things you see and everything to do with the way you see them.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ndash; Elliott Erwitt
